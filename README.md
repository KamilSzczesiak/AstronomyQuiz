# Welcome to my Online Quiz Project Website!

## This project is a Online Astronomy Quiz Website to demenstrate my skills and experience

 ### Approach
 How did I approach the brief?
 I began by planning what theme I'm going to go for. In this case I chose astronomy as that's a topic I enjoy. I then planned out what questions I'm going to ask and the layout of the quiz.

 Biggest challenge?
 The biggest challenge in the developing of this project was implementing the different types of questions. I particularly found it challenging to include the multiple-answer type questions.

 ### Future Improvements
 If I had more time and better resources, how would I change or improve this project?

 If I did have more time, I'd like to spend more time on creating a nicer design and layout, perhaps go for less background images and make it look a bit more professional. If I had more time I would also like to implement a highscore perhaps, so users can locally challenge themselves to improve. In addition to that, adding a 'pass rate' could also be an option, so that the user needs to get above a certain amount to pass. Something else I could do could maybe be organising the files better, and seperating the code for better readability and reusability.
